# shinterra_fortress

This is an attempt to have a wholly new world defined for use with the dwarf fortress engine, circa v2012; since we have yet to see how the incoming new version of the game will work and how flexible its raws are versus site/city/dungeon rendering, etc, it has yet to be determiend what, if anything, will be done to support that.

# Change log:

## version 0.0.0

* forked from jeturcotte/raw_dwarf_meat for complete and utter destruction
